# ðŸŒ± Terraform Lifecycle:

### When you use Terraform to manage your infrastructure as code, it goes through several phases in its lifecycle:
### Initialization > Planning > Apply > Destroy(If needed)

## Lifecycle rules:
1. Create Before Destroy:
- Sometimes, when you need to change a resource, Terraform might need to destroy the existing one and then create a new one to apply the changes.
- ```create_before_destroy = true``` for a resource, Terraform will create the new resource before destroying the old one.
- This can help in scenarios where you want to ensure there's no downtime during updates.  
Eg:
```tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
  filename = "/roots/pet.txt"
  content = "Hello pet"
  file_permission = "0700"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

2. Prevent Destroy:
-  Imagine you have a critical resource that you never want to accidentally destroy, like a database holding important data.
-  You can use the ```prevent_destroy``` argument to prevent Terraform from destroying that resource.
-  This adds an extra layer of safety, ensuring that such resources can't be deleted by mistake.
Eg: 
```tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
  filename = "/roots/pet.txt"
  content = "Hello pet"
  file_permission = "0700"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```
3. Prevent Destroy:
- Imagine you have a valuable file on your computer, and you want to make sure you don't accidentally delete it.
- ```Prevent destroy``` in Terraform is a bit like marking a resource as "do not delete" so that even if you tell Terraform to remove it, it won't.  
Eg:
```tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
  filename = "/roots/pet.txt"
  content = "Hello pet"
  file_permission = "0700"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```
4. Ignore Changes:
- This rule allows you to ignore specific changes to attributes of a resource.
- This can be helpful for properties that might change but aren't important for Terraform to manage.
- Eg:
```tf
resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
  ami = "ami-09u898979"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "Project-A"
  }
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [ tags ]
  }
}
```
- If someone changes the tags directly in the AWS Management Console or via another method outside of Terraform, Terraform won't try to reconcile those changes or mark the resource for an update due to tag modifications.
