### Imagine you're running a website on a virtual server in the cloud. You've set up the server and all its configurations using Terraform. Now, you need to make some changes, like updating the web server software to a newer version.
### In a traditional way (not immutable), you might connect to the server, update the software, and hope that everything goes smoothly. But sometimes, these changes can introduce unexpected issues, and it's hard to go back to the previous state if something goes wrong.

## What is Immutable?
- "Immutable Infrastructure" means that when you need to make changes to your infrastructure, instead of modifying the existing components directly, you create new and updated components from scratch while leaving the old ones untouched.
- This ensures that you always have a reliable and consistent setup, and any changes are made by building new pieces rather than altering existing ones.
- This is what **Terraform** does

### With immutable infrastructure in Terraform, you would:
1. **Create a New Configuration:** You'd create a new Terraform configuration that represents the changes you want. This might involve specifying the updated software version and any other necessary adjustments.
2. **Apply the New Configuration:** Instead of modifying the existing server directly, you would apply the new Terraform configuration. This would create a new virtual server instance with the updated software and configurations.
3. **Testing and Validation**: Before directing traffic to the new instance, you can thoroughly test and validate it to ensure everything is working as expected.
4. **Switch Traffic:** Once you're confident in the new instance, you can switch the incoming traffic from the old server to the new one. This might involve updating load balancers or DNS settings.
5. **Destroy Old Resources:** After confirming that the new instance is working well, you can use Terraform to safely destroy the old resources, such as the old server instance. This cleanup step ensures you're not paying for or managing unnecessary components.
